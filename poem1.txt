Midst Of Morning SunShine


In the midst of morning sunshine,

I walk down the old cracked stairs which seemed like generations of neglect,

Waiting to be colored, waiting to be revived, waiting to be Healed.


In the midst of a warm ambience,

I lay down next to scattering plants, which had gone dry and pale,

Waiting to be watered, waiting to be loved , waiting to Live.


In the midst of a tiny pleasant yard,

I stroll around the lively, scented soil, there waited a tiny lifeless creature,

Waiting to be buried, waiting to be cared for, waiting to exhibit the power of Impermanence.


Then, In the midst of my thoughts,

I dig the soil which now smelled of despair and helplessness, 

Waiting to breakdown what is left of the remaining to every bits of Mortality.



 So I ponder,

Once what bloomed and blossomed in its beauty will soon wither and fade.

Once what spinned and swayed will soon stumble and fall.

And once what was held dear and near will soon slip and slip and slither by the grip.

Oh, It is the beauty of this strange Nature,

wether we are the puppets of the Cosmos

the puppets of our time

Or puppets of our mind.

 It is only sensible to laugh at this strange Existence of Nature. üçÅ
