I'm Nobody! Who are you? (260)
Emily Dickinson - 1830-1886

I'm Nobody! Who are you?
Are you – Nobody – too?
Then there's a pair of us!
Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!

How dreary – to be – Somebody!
How public – like a Frog –
To tell one's name – the livelong June –
To an admiring Bog!
Roses are red,
the earth is dying 
the end
